# _Auto-segmentation and Classification of NME Lesions via 3D CNN-Transformer Fusion: A Multi-center study based on Multimodal MRI_

_An accurate model for the detection and classification of non-mass enhancement lesions in the breast was established by integrating multimodal data and automatically segmenting the features of non-mass enhancement lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI)._
